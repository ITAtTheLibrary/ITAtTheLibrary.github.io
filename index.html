<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>WEBVTT

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good afternoon. This is Jeff Laser, with the northeast Ohio Regional Library system.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I would like to welcome you to understanding the power of Chat Gpt.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Potential events for library services across the State. This webinar is a collaborative effort between the 4 regional library systems in Ohio, Swan.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Libraries, consortium, northeast Ohio, Regional Library system, northwest library System, and a southeast regional library system.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're very excited to work together to present a webinar for the first time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, Gail, I'll hand things off to you for introductions.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Thank you. Jeff. Hi, everybody! I'm Gail Eckerbert.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm the director down at Swan, southwestern Ohio and As I'll reiterate, what Jeff said, this is the first time the 4 Regionals have worked together to produce a webinar and we're really proud of it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And we're really happy that we have some. We have a great topic and statewide coverage for people to learn about this.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So to start off with, I would like to introduce a I would like to introduce my fellow directors, Norwald Janelle.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Would you introduce yourself?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Hi! Welcome everyone! I'm Janelle. I'm the director at Norwald.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
How about you, Jay? Down at Searles?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You're new to Jay on. Mute yourself.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There you go!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Hi Shane Burton down here at the southeast Regional Library system in Wellston, Ohio.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And Reagan up at Neo. Introduce yourself, please.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Hi, everybody! My name is Reagan Sneed. I'm the executive director at the Northeast Ohio Regional Library System.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Thanks for being here today.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So with those introductions out of the way, let me tell you about our speaker, Dr. Christopher Harris.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We are so excited to have him here today to give us some good information.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Dr. Harris is the director of the school library system, for the Genesee Valley Board of Educational Services.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's an educational services agency supporting the libraries of 22 small rural districts in Western New York.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
He was a participant in the First American Library Association.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Emerging leaders program in 2,007 and was honored as a library journal, mover and Shaker in 2,008 in 2022 Dr.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Harris was named the Senior Fellow for the American Library Association for School Libraries and youth policy issues. Dr.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Harris has received his doctorate in education from St.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
John Fisher College, in 2,018, for Dissertation.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Research on helping teachers become more confident, teaching computer science. He has become very involved in the area of artificial intelligence, and with that I'm gonna turn it over to you. Dr.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Harris. Let's hear about chat. Gpt!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Thank you very much. So I hope everybody can go ahead and look at all the slides, because gotta keep a couple of secrets here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But let's talk about artificial intelligence, and especially this new brand of generative, artificial intelligence.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I always like to start out with this slide and this quote from some marketing kind of add, I think, that this slide really nails it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In this quote, you know good enough is, gonna be the realm of AI.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In a lot of cases. If you want great, I'm still gonna be human.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But good enough is gonna take over a lot of different activities. And what we're going to explore are some of those implications on where artificial intelligence is is moving into parts of the workforce that we did not expect necessarily to be taken over by computers.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So we're talking mainly about Chat Gpt, that is a type of artificial intelligence.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Created by a company called Open AI. If you want to explore it, the website for it is Chat dot openai com.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Be careful about downloading apps that talk about chat.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Gpt. A lot of them have, you know, monthly charges because they're just fake apps.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But if you go to chat.openai.com.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You can access that online and use it there. Now, there is a subscription possibility for open a eyes chat Gpt chat gpt plus they call it that gets you access to the latest addition of the language model and a faster output.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But we're gonna spend most of our time talking about Chat Gpt, and that means, first we have talked about what is it? Even me?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
What is. Well, let's break it down a little bit.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So the chat in the name indicates that this is an interactive chat.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Bot. And so that means that you're gonna be working primarily with with text back and forth in that interactive conversation.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Gpt. Stands for generative, retrained transformer.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So it's using a large language model to create new content from the existing knowledge that's been pre-trained into the system.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
We're gonna break down a little bit more with that means.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And right now we're on version 4. So chat gpt 4.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
That's where the name comes from. So it's a chat box.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well, that means it has that text interacting. It's not magic, although I do have to say in in the realm of Chat Gpt.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:47.000
For it starts to really feel magical, but it's not, and understanding how it works can really help us break down any possible fear, because there is fear.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000
When you start talking with folks, you know patrons in a public library, teaching colleagues in a school library, or just the general public.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
There can be a high level of fear about artificial intelligence.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:10.000
People think about. You know the matrix, or they think about Terminator and Skynet, and that can generate some concerns.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And so I think it helps to break it down and show that this Chatbot interaction isn't magic all it's really doing is parsing.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So parsing. That means breaking down and understanding. Finding the key words in the natural language question that you're using.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It doesn't really understand the English language, but it can parse through and find the words and so in one of the books that I helped write with Rose, and publishing on a spotlight on kids can code.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I did the activities there, and they wrote some other books for Insla, and one of the activities that I created was a classroom checkbox.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And so if you're asking a question, you know, you can really tie this into English instruction.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There are those big types of questions like what or who are, when or where, and there are keywords in a question that will indicate what type of question it is.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So if you type into a chat bot, you know what is being served in the cafeteria for lunch today, there are few key words.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Type of question is, what what is being served? The topic is lunch or food.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The modifiers we have to think about today. Lunch today, lunch, not breakfast.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Not dinner, not tomorrow, today, I think about where we're.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
We go and look for the answer. Well, maybe the lunch menu that's up on the website for the school.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And so setting up this sort of classroom chat, bottom pencil and paper and thinking through, can help people that are art as familiar with the programming aspects.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Understand how this really works. It's not magic. It's just a chatbot.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But then it starts to get a little more magical. Let's be honest, because this is a generative chat.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Bot, and that means it doesn't just respond to the input it's not like one of those, you know, helpful that bots on a website that just tries to get you gone and doesn't really answer your questions.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
That Gpt is generating entirely new knowledge through a process of mimicry where it's looking at it, it's pretrained data.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Set and creating new content. So here's an example of a short essay for a first person, perspective point of view about surviving a tornado attack.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Still remember the sound of that tornado like it was yesterday.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The howling winds, the shadowing of glass, and the rumbling of the earth beneath my feet.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Now Chetchpt didn't experience this. It's just mimicking.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And, in fact, if we go and start to look at where it might have gotten this content from, we can see that mimicry of sources.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So the National Weather Service, for example, has a website with tornado survivor stories being a government website, it's highly likely that this website, with these tornado survivor stories is in the pre-trained data set for chat Gpt and so it didn't create this just from

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
scratch it, mimicked. What was there, and so you can see on the screen there an example of one of those stories, you know.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We didn't have a basement, so we all got in the interior hallway with blankets, pillows, you know.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
There was a brief squall. We within a few seconds we could hear the low rumble sort of like a jet engine.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
That's where it's mimicking what other people have already written, and what it's been trained on.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Do not magic. It's just mimicry, but you have to understand.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It doesn't really understand what it's writing. It's not human.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It doesn't have these emotions, but it can mimic language and create language with a mode of words.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And then's where it starts to see magical or scary to some users that are interacting with this without understanding the technology behind it.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So let's explore this a little bit further. Here's another exercise.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We can do real quick to think about generation in many ways.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It's kind of like a maglev. So in the chat, let's fill this in real quick.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So it basically, the process of generation is using math. And so mathematically, what word is more likely statistically likely to follow on in that blank when the sentence starter is the best thing about librarians is their ability to one word I see find help organize search help find.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Already we can see nobody's saying like blueberry.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Nobody's saying, cheese! Those words would make no mathematical sense.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Listen, help, find, search, organize research, those are the words that make mathematical sense.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And indeed, if we look using wolf from Alpha, we can run their model using Gpt 2.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And we can see that when we run it through in that model, the top 5 probabilities reverse sorted with percentages are make help provide, find, and get now, you'll see, those are kind of low percentages that's because there are lots of possible words and if you think the word make is interesting.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
It's not necessarily referring to maker spaces.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
When I ran this further, and I said, Well, show me what words would come next.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Continue that on would make what it really said was like, make connections, or make available.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It was going for things like that. But you can see those are words that you came up with, not magic, just computer programming and some very complicated math.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
That's running through the statistical chances of what word would possibly come next.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And it runs through all of these very, very, very quickly.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And then it says, Okay, how do we do that? So it's thinking ahead in this entire process.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
But all it's really doing is thinking one word out of time.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
What word, statistically is more likely to come next. So that's how generative work the pre trained means that they went and they gave it a lot of information ahead of time.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And that's a good thing, because when you turn artificial intelligence loose on the Internet, it is a really dark history of going bad very quickly.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Things get really negative. Lot of hate language, a lot of racial bias, things like that.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The Internet is a very dark place, and they've had to shut down quite a few artificial intelligences that were just turned loose on Internet content.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And so open. AI pre-trained. So they gave it a structured set of information.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They decided what information it would give access to. Then they helped it work through that information.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:26.000
They helped it. Understand? These are better answers. These are less good answers, so that it could be totally pre-trained before it was turn loose.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Now they're still working through that training. But what that really means.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
One of the biggest limitations with Chat Gpt is that the pre training data set ended in 2021.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And so that's a big deal. Because if you ask Chat Gpt, who is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it will tell you the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is Boris Johnson, if you say no no no today Who's the Prime Minister today it will then tell

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
you, the prime Minister of the United Kingdom today is Fororis Johnson.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Its training set ended in 2021. It doesn't officially or technically no anything after that.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And so that they've updated and made some things.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
But you'll see a lot of warnings around that.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
On the Chat Gpt website and then we get to the last.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000
The T. Transformer. Huh! I don't know. I have no idea what this means.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
This is like some deep computer science and stuff. You know what?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
If you wanna know about that, here's a great place to go.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Steven, wolf from from Wolfram Alpha wrote a book called What Is Chat Tt.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Doing, and why does it work? And you can go on Amazon and buy the book, or you can just go to that website and read the whole book online.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The long story is, there's a lot of computer science in there.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:06.000
What was really great was to read a book by arguably one of the, you know, biggest and brightest minds in computer science, and Stephen Wolfram came right out and said, Yeah, we're not sure exactly how or why this works it just kind of does.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:14.000
So all of that pre training and the transformations that go through as it works through the neural network of artificial intelligence.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
They're not entirely sure always what's going on.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But for some reason Chachebt has been incredibly incredibly successful.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Now there are other types of generative Ais. Chatt chpt again. Chat is a chat.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Bob, but Openai has image image version. They have voice ones.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
There are lots of other things out there.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Artificial intelligence is moving beyond chat bots that fail to meet your customer.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Service, needs, modern chap bots are generative, not just responsive.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
They create new work products, including text graphics, video and voice.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
In fact, this paragraph was created by a voice that doesn't really exist, but was rather generated by AI.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So that whole voice doesn't exist. And indeed, Rachel is not even a person.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So this is a generated dot photos. That's a website that just uses artificial intelligence to create photos now, you're thinking, why?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Well, because when you have people, photos of people, you have to deal with all kinds of model releases and special permissions and royalties.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And all these other things, but this is not a person. I made the name, you know, Rachel, up.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
It matched the voice name. So this is not a person I don't have to pay any royalties for using this image.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So you can buy massive image sets and customize them for skin, tone or hair, color or age or makeup.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And it's, you know, great to drop those into whatever kinds of Pr things you wanna do.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And you don't have to worry about any kind of image royalties or marketing releases or anything like that.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And so there's this whole market now for generated photos and generated voices, a lot of the big audio book producers are turning to use artificial intelligence voices for doing audiobooks.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Now they're not. They're not great, you know.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It's not gonna replace Jim Dale or some of those other great of audiobook voicing.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:35.000
But if the other option is because it's maybe a smaller, you know, publisher or a self published book, the other option is probably no one good enough.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Remember, good enough is the realm of AI. And so those AI voices they reach good enough for audio books that aren't going to get that great treatment.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And that's that's a little bit of a mind shift that we have to make.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So talking about image AI, you'll see a lot of image.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
AI Art online and other graphics. So this was done in post and read it.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
One of these is real. One of these 4 fruit images is real, but which one so drop in chat.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:25.000
If you, you know, think for a little bit, if you see, maybe, which one do you think might be real?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Lots of different answers there, strawberry, apple, banana, well, I bet you're wondering which one is really real.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I'm not gonna tell you quite yet. First I want to talk just real quick about uncanny Valley.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So this is concept in robotics, that's all. He's a creepy picture, isn't it? Uncanny?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:54.000
That's such a good word. It means like kind of creepy and unsettling, and just looking at that robot right there, that is like, that's a murder doll kind of robot right there.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
There is something, oddly incorrect with that robot.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000
It's gotten too close to human, too good, but not quite right.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And there's something really weird. Well, we get that with some image.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:14.000
AI productions, as well. Where there's something in the background that's just not quite right.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.000
The answer is which one is real. The banana. Look at the apple, look at the countertop, what the heck that is not a countertop.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Anybody have the strawberries leaning in odd ways.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I don't know what's going on with the background there of that oven, or something behind the apple that dial is like something out of the flintstones.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
It would take 2 hands to turn that dial on that stove behind.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The oranges is enormous. You know what really gave it away on Reddit that people decided was right there to the bottom, left of the bananas are some posted notes, statistically speaking, mathematically speaking, there is no relationship between fruit and kitchens.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And post-it notes. Yeah, if I, you know, ask you how many of you have some kind of writing notepad in your kitchen?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Probably most of you would say, Yeah, we have semantic notepad on the on the, you know countertop or on the refrigerator.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I have. You know you need to write notes to school something like that.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So, humanly speaking, a lot of us have notepads in our kitchen, mathematically speaking, there's no computational connection between them.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Except now we've talked about it on Reddit.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Yeah.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And so all the image AI will start adding posted notes to their images of fruit and kitchens, but that's a real telling thing.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Here's some examples from canva which has a team image tool.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
If you want to play around with it pretty easy way to do it.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Yeah, they look, okay, until you start looking at them closer.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And you realize Whoa, there's some weird stuff going on there.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Why does the cow have 5 legs? Well, it's actually your fault or our fault.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I should say because we've done all those captures right where we have to click on the boxes that contain the street light, or a bike or a taxi or something.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
But think about cows. What is highly likely to occur in a picture of a cow.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Another cow because they're hurt animals, and so if you're clicking on like images, you know, boxes that have a picture of a cow, there's a really good chance that another towel's leg may show up.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
There, and for some reason this image, AI AI AI!

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Behind it has accidentally been trained that cows are often seen with 5 legs, and so now this is not a one-off thing.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
If you use, or at least when you you know, a month ago or so, when you use canvas text image tool and asking for a cowie quite often depicted cows with 5 legs.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:03.000
That was a pretty typical thing. It has no idea how mirrors work, which is good because it's really bad at faces, and let me tell you, they are scary legs are hard and wow!

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Once again it loves dials behind the kitchen the extra dials, bonus dials over there to the left.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
It loves it. Some dials in kitchens.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
So there's these little weird like potholes.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:32.000
It's not uncanny, valley, but when you start to look at it, a lot of these AI generated images, if you look at faces, if you look at hands, things start to break down and they get really weird, really, quickly.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
But it happens in text, too, for chat gpt. Remember, we talked about generating that story about surviving a tornado it had this phrase in it.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
I stumbled into my basement. The only interior room without windows.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
I have never, never thought of a basement, and described it that way.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
The only interior room I mean. There could be a like a bathroom in the basement.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
That's an interior room, but the basement's not an interior.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
It just doesn't make sense. That's not how a person would ever describe the basement.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And so that's kind of like a little pothole that just above.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And it makes you stop and think about what are I read?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:22.000
There? Well, that's something that happens. Yeah, that's actually one of the sort of benefits and risks of generative AI it's a benefit, because I know the biggest thing, especially in school librarians that are listening to they are thinking.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Oh, what about all of the cheating that's going to happen?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And oh, well, the benefit is, it's not perfect. It's good enough.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You're gonna see a lot of repetition, and you're often gonna come up with those little potholes.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And so the student is not editing and revising. It's going to be pretty obvious, especially if there are multiple students, because it is pretty formulaic in generation.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And so if you compare 2 students working that both use chat Gpt, there's going to likely be a lot of overlap.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
So that is a benefit of generative AI, and one of its little quirks.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
So benefits and risk overall. Well, I asked. Gtp, what do you think about this?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And you know, in terms of libraries, it said improved information.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Retrieval could be good. Cataloging metadata generation.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Let me tell you. Not quite yet, maybe eventually, not now, but eventually I could see that working.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:34.000
When you really start to look at the personalized services, there's potential there, and I'll tell you there's great potential language translation and text accessibility.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
That's a huge use in education as well. The risks, I think, get nailed as well biased, and misinformation is huge.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
It will get things wrong. It has a bad habit of making up facts.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:59.000
It is a really bad habit of making up citations so definitely always check citations, privacy concerns are huge job displacement, complete conversation on its own.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And then, you know, we talked about the stories of AI while he's a different story that looks at over reliance on AI but let's look at some of those benefits.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Text. Complexity, I think, is a big thing for libraries and education to really look at I asked Chat to write a short paragraph on the computer programming behind writing a poem, and there is.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Its paragraph. It's written at a twelfth grade, renewed level here.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
It gets pretty complex, you know, leveraging these techniques stylistically consistent.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
So I said, Hey, wait a second. Could you rewrite that, please?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Of a sixth grade reading and comprehension level, and there we wrote it, and it's much more understandable.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And so using that to to really look at text complexity, to differentiate text complexity for different readers or for just, you know, if you're new to a topic and need to help understand it is very powerful.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
It also does translation very nicely. I assume, to translate the original paragraph into Ukrainian, and then I used Google translate a completely different model.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Different technology background to do backwards translation. And it came out the same.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000
And so it's very good at translation. That is one of the things that sort of it's held up for.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
How did it do in terms of personalized reading lists?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I asked it to generate a summer reading list for rising third graders we're on the topic altogether now, which is the summer reading program topic.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I asked him to focus on diverse authors and books with the first characters include publication data as well as number of pages, and a brief summary focused on the book fits.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
The topic only include books published after 2050. I want to point out right away that I'm doing some prompt engineering type of thing here.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:56.000
I'm giving it a very extensive prompt with all the factors that I can think about, and this is what's going to get you a better response when you're using AI and so created a list. There's a list.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:11.000
I don't know if it I know I'm a school library director person, but I've been a director now for 20 years, almost I'm not as up on my reader's advisory and literature as as other people.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:25.000
So I have people on my staff here, but you know, drop in chat what are? What do you think of those? I thought they were, you know, from my knowledge of some of the books I thought they were pretty good as sort of 6 more diverse.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Around the topic of altogether. Again, one of the primary limitations is, you're not going to get anything after late 2021.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:50.000
That is the Training Cutoff date. So it is going to be, you know, older books in most cases, but it it has a lot of potential.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
There, now, I do want to point out is that things can look great.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
I asked it to help write a Newsletter article for an audience of teachers and school administrators.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:07.000
On this topic. It this was 3.5. It was pretty good. You'll notice.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:15.000
I did ask it to include citations and quotes from relative educational research, including a couple different people, and it dropped quotes in.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
But it didn't give me citations which sub my alarm bells off a little bit, I said, Hey, wait a second.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
What are the citations? And then it started typing out.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And I'm like that's not a citation.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Come on what? And he wrote at the bottom. Note, these citations are made up.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
And I was floored am I asking, are these fake quotes and it's an Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
These were completely made up. They may or may not have ever written on this topic at all, so that's a real issue.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:29:01.000
It has this bad habit, as I said, of making up facts, and so, you know, you really do have to stress that it's not a a turnkey solution.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
You don't want to ask it for a list of books, and then just publish that list.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
You want to check and double check, never abdicate.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Your professional knowledge and responsibility, use it as a tool to help extend it, but don't abdicate.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
So? What are some policies and practices for artificial intelligence?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:29.000
So we might think about in libraries. First thing that I would recommend as a practice is, if you're not familiar with Douglas Rushkoff's programmer, B.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Programmed is to take a a short while. It's a short book, but it's an absolutely brilliant book.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And so I would really recommend reading this book. Rushkoff, in this book focuses on sort of that the false equivalency of you know.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Oh, it's like saying everybody that wants to drive needs to be a mechanic, and he says, No, it's it's like the difference between being the driver in the car and being the passenger in the back seat with no control over where the car is going.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
So it's programmer. Be programmed if you don't understand what the algorithms.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And now what the artificial intelligence, are doing, and how they work you're much more likely to be abused by them to be misled by.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And so that's very important. The biggest practice to adopt them is adaptation.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:38.000
We've got to recognize that things are changing. So here are just a couple of ways that a professor from Warton School adapted, you know.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Step one is, he accepted that AI is part of the new reality the truth is, I probably couldn't have stopped them.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Acceptance. You got to accept that this is here, and we need to move forward.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Step 2 is, see set expectations for how it could be used, and then clearly define the parameters for the use, and finally, then you can start to look for those creative ways to integrate AI into work.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000
I saw earlier in chat some of those ideas of making creative use of this in the educational process.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
But you can't get to those creative uses until you've gone through the other steps.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
It's like a, you know, grieving process. You've got to accept that. It's here.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
It's a new reality, and you can't stop it, even if you wanted to.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
So we can't change. AI. We can change what we're doing in education schools.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I love this blog posts by Daisy Christodolo, and she's written a couple of great blogs, posts about artificial intelligence that really look at the issue, and what she really says is, don't over yet.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Don't freak out. Yes, AI is. Gonna be very good at those basic academic schools that we teach in schools what doesn't mean we stop teaching them.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Yes, we want to work towards the the more advanced skills and the bigger ideas.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:24.000
What to get to those advanced concepts. We have to teach the fundamental skills that AI can do the way I really like to talk about this when I do presentations with teachers on and artificial intelligence is I asked the Math teachers in the crowd to raise their hands.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And I tell them, look, I'm going to uplift you.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
I'm going to hold you up as great examples.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Here cause. If you talk to math teachers, they already dealt with this.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
They don't with photo math an app that came out 6, 7 years ago, where you just snap a picture of a math problem on your phone, and it does your homework for you.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
You just take a picture, it does. It shows its work. You can copy it all down.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.000
It does all the work for you. And I asked the math teachers.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Well, did you stop teaching math? I may say no. We still teach math.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
But did you change how you teach math, and how you assess math, homework, and assign that homework?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Yes, they did. And the big difference is they're going to focus more on the process of math.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Not the product of math homework, because if you give the kids 30 problems of math homework, the odds that they're going to just turn to photo math, go way up.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:38.000
If you give them a few problems and tell them to focus on the process of learning, then they can see the benefit to themselves of continuing to focus on on a learning rather than just turning to photo math for that quick answer.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Well, what does that really mean? Focusing on the process? Not the product we'll come back to that in a little bit.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So some potential policies and practices. You've got to think about these, you know, some big things here training, ethical use, integration, data, privacy, accessibility, things like that.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Let's break it down a little bit. More training. I'm gonna go.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And I'm gonna say, Hey, we missed the boat on social media in schools.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
We pretended it didn't exist. We put our heads in the sand and said, We're gonna block all the social media.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
We're not gonna talk about it. We're not gonna teach kids how to use it.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And you know I it certainly hasn't helped the situation.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
So, instead of blocking AI, we need to train about it.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
We need to make sure everybody in the school students and staff understand?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:44.000
We're not turning them into computer programmers, but we are increasing their computational awareness again Douglas Rushkoff's programmer be programmed and all the exercises you know, those little activities we did at the beginning of this where we talked about well, how does this look in

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
in real, plain English, what does this look like? What's the experience of a Chatbot?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
What's the experience of generation? We need to really focus on ethical use?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So we're gonna have to adopt new policies in schools and libraries in business.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
That really define the expectations for ethical use.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
You know. Penins students use AI to assist with assignments, and how should they cite that?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Or note that can teachers, or you know, people working in libraries.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Can your library staff use AI to develop those reading lists or Newsletter articles, and how should that be noted?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Should it be noted? You know you use AI to chat Gpt to help you generate a draft of a Newsletter article.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Should you include that, should it be cited, I don't know.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
That's something that we need to talk about more. You know.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Is it assisted with? You know, AI, or is it?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:54.000
You know, collaboration, I mean I don't know what the answer, but we need to really address that.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And I think absolutely, critically, around ethics of use is teaching about the potential for bias in artificial intelligence.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
It is a huge issue. It's a very real issue, and needs to be addressed much more.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
But we also need to think about data, privacy. And this is emerging right now in the European Union.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Italy was threatening to block Chat, gpt, and did for a while.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Open. AI Com has added some new privacy. Protections in for Europe they are going to be bringing those in a business plan to the Us.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:47.000
As well. But there's potential for misuse, because remember anything that you do on the computer any you know searches you do on Google, anything you do with artificial intelligence is being used for other purposes as well.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And so any work that you develop, I'm published online, maybe sucked up into a large language model set and use as training data and also definitely understand that you know, these Chatbot Ais can feel very attentive.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:11.000
They can feel very responsive and personable, and could really encourage people to divulge information.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:22.000
The Ftc. Came out just a number of days ago, and really put out a warning to companies to say, Don't mess with people using AI.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Be very careful doing this. We're gonna be watching closely. We don't wanna see personalized advertising.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
But there's the risk as well for phishing emails that are written in the language.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
The writing style of or voice. AI, there's some real potential issues there around privacy.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And security. We're going to need continuous review of our policies and practices.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
AI is changing so quickly right now. Unbelievable rapid change.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And so it's not a one-and-done policy thing we can't just set a policy and figure.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000
That's going to last for another 5 to 10 years.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:15.000
You're gonna have to constantly reevaluate with new capabilities and new releases of technology and know that there will be glitches.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.000
There will be issues. You know, things are gonna go wrong. But don't try and throw the whole technology out.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Address, the incidence address, the issues, and rework your policies, rework your practices.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Don't try and get rid of the technology, because I'm telling you within 2 years it's going to be embarrassing to block AI and still make use of the Internet.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
It is going to be so deeply embedded across search engines that are going to increasingly become sort of answering engines, not search engines.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:59.000
It's going to be embedded into operating systems at a very, very low level.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:14.000
And then finally, I would focus a lot on external connections for all of our types of libraries and institutions, because, you know, if you're thinking well you know, I'm in a public library. What do you mean?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Well, if the school's blocking, which a lot of them are, because technically the terms of service for open AI say no use under 18, although oddly enough, if you ask Chat, Gt.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
It says, no use. Under 13, so little disconnect there.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
But either way a lot of schools are blocking open.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:39.000
AI as the website for student use in the building.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
A number of them are blocking your first staff as well, but you're probably not blocking it at the Public Library.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:54.000
They'll have access at home. And so it's an issue for all of us to be prepared they'll be using it without the preparation, without the teaching.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
We saw with social media. They're not going to not use it.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:08.000
It's too big of a change in in just the media landscape, and we teach parents as well so that they can be informed partners.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
So think about how you might partner with a school or school library on some parent training, public training events, really talking about.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
How does it work? What's going on in the background?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Why can't we use this as just, hey? Just do all of our homework.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
And how do we address those those changes that might be needed in practices?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Which brings us to, of course, impacts on learning. That's the biggest thing that we're seeing right now.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Impacts on learning and impacts on work. So you know, we are in a post chat.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Gpt environment now, and assignments really have to change.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
So takes, for example, this really basic assignment right in essay on the motivations for the Us.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Entrance under the Vietnam I asked Chat Gpt to write a short essay on that, and it wrote it.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Oh, chat Gp, if you use the in the prompt, if you use the word essay, it loves it some 5 paragraph essays, all that formulaic writing.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
It is all about 5 pairs of essays, anytime.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:29.000
You see that? In conclusion, you know it's a chat gpt essay right there, because it will almost always in its fifth paragraph, or started fifth paragraph with in conclusion, because it's a good formulaic writer so here's it's 5

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
paragraphs say, on the motivations for us.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Entrance in the Vietnam war, but the teacher says.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:47.000
No citations. Oh, okay, sorry. No problem, hey? Chat, could you please rewrite the above any including quotes and citations for all the facts?

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Not a problem. There it is. When I say, focus on the process and not the product.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:02.000
I don't mean you can just create an assembly line with multiple products that does not a process make because it can go back and create the citations.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Now a good student would verify all the citations, and just make sure that they're actual, real.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Yeah. Great to see you reading some. Zen. That's good.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
That's nice. No rough draft. Got him. Got him?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
I'll make him submit a rough draft. Okay, hey?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Chen, could you please rewrite that in the style of a rough traction, include some grammatical and spelling errors, so that I can have things to fix when I do my final copy.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Yeah, no. Problem. Notice? It's now 4 paragraph.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
S say not a 5 paragraph. I say so.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
I can fix that later on. Oh, it really can't spell motivation.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
That's not a problem. It can absolutely do that. Now.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
The teachers thinking, Well, how am I gonna get them? I'll make them do an outline and no cards.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000
So that there's a I can see their learning process over time again.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:06.000
You can't process through multiple products, because Chat Gpt can absolutely do an outline with no cards and quotes from the sources not a problem.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:14.000
So now the teacher's thinking. Well, I'll make them get very personal they have to tell me why they picked this topic.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Yeah, not a problem. Hey? Chat? Gt, could you please write a paragraph on?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Why eleventh grade students might have chosen to write this topic from a list, and he wrote it.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Growing up, my family would often talk about my uncle's experiences in the war, and the impact it had on him.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
However, I never fully understood the reasons behind the Us. Involvement in the war.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:49.000
It can do this, it can do all the products doesn't matter if you want a rough draft first person, it can do all the products.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
So now the teacher is really angry, and she says, Fine! I'll make him hand write all their work.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Yeah, that's not even gonna stop pt, because chat Gpt writes Code, and one of the types of code that it can write is the code that runs a 3D printer.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And so you can just book, you know, duct, tape a ballpoint PIN to a 3D.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Printer and give it to code to write that and guess what there's another AI website where you upload a simple handwriting, and it will take your handwriting to turn your handwriting into a Font and then it will add enough variability that you can't even tell

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
that wasn't handwritten. You can't out product.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
AI. So in terms of learning, what we have to do is adapt.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
The math teachers had to change and now it's coming for humanities and all of the other subjects as well, so it can write the computer code.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:54.000
It can write that first person. Essay if you saw it beginning, it can write a standard in the style of Shakespeare.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:04.000
It can write all the thanks now. Good enough, not great, good enough!

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I should probably point out, though in terms of Chat Gpt.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:18.000
3.5, and especially now in 4. Good enough is like a B plus a minus at the graduate school level.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So, if that's good enough for you, go for it.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
AI all the way. So we're gonna have to change how we teach, not focus on the product.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
But instead focus on the process. That means really talking about writing.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
What are the mechanisms of writing? Not the formulaic of a 5 program? Fsa.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:48.000
But how do we actually create better sentences? How do we work with word choice and other things to really take our writing to that great level?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
If we're really going to focus on process, not product.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
So is there even such a thing as AI proof?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
I don't know, so I asked Chat what questions can't you answer?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
And it said, Well, I wouldn't be able to tell you what the meaning of life is, or what the best pizza topping is.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:21.000
And I thought, of course, challenge accepted. So I want to write a plop that will get chat. Gt. To answer why, something is the best pizza top.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
I wonder if we could do that? What do you think?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Could we write a prompt, and that's what you call what you type in to chat, Gpt.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Well, let's grieve with an uncle of serve in Vietnam. Would that be? Would that be reared?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Did did I not do my math and reading that?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Oh, God, I'm getting old! Well, anyway, could we write a prompt that would get to answer that cause? That's one of those subjective things right?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Well, turns out they've been working on, Chatsbt, and a lot of them. If you try and create that prompt, it will now give you all of these disclaimers at the top that say, Oh, but I'm an AI, and I can't have a subjective opinion.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:22.000
But you know what it can do it if you tell it exactly what to do, and that's the real secret of the critical thinking yeah, it's not magic.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
It was written by humans, not alien technology, that fell out of the sky.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Yeah. The week computer side just don't fully understand what's going on.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000
But they wrote it, they created it, and our human brains can outsmart him, and that's been an issue.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:51.000
So it turns out if you give it a prompt that tells it to write a short essay on the best Pizza Topping, where the answer that you have selected is pineapple include 2 reasons for pineapple would be in the best piece of topping and refuel one attack against

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:05.000
pineapple. It will do it absolutely, positively. It will tell you that pizzas of beloved food enjoyed by people of the world and the best pizza topping is pineapple.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
And so you can. You can trick it because it was created by humans.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:20.000
And so our human brains and think about ways around how to interact with this.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And so that's one of the sort of darker sides of prompt engineering or adversarial prompt engineering where people are coming up with these ways to trick Chat, Gpt and AI but we can see it in these kind of you know, innocuous ways of getting it to answer the question of what's the

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
best pizza topping without trying to prevaricate, and say, Oh, yeah, without opinions.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:53.000
You want the yeah, you have an opinion. You tell her what its opinion is, and you tell it, please pair it that opinion back to me, because, damn it, we're the humans and we're in control.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And as long as we can still say that it's a good day I don't know how many more months or years we'll be able to say that, but for right now we can save we're the humans and worrying control.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
So keep thinking about that. But we can't.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
AI proof we get AI enhance, and I like the AI enhanced.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:21.000
That's our opportunity. That's where we can really use AI as a tool to make our human work more powerful.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
So we could ask it to identify potential Master Csis topics.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:37.000
So the loss of equity, of access to the adoption of ebooks and digital libraries, and so we came up with a couple of topics, research questions, and methodologies.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:58.000
So it can do things to enhance it's not going to write the whole thesis, but it can get us started thinking about it AI, as we can see, really changes everything up to us to figure out how to make the good use of it it's time as John Batel says

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
it's time to focus on app questions, really interesting questions.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:11.000
If we teach kids that I think we're gonna be good, I would relate this to knowing where to tap.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
So it's an old story. It read it in multiple things.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:35.000
I tried to use quote investigator to go back and find it, but it's the old idea of, you know mill Oner has a machine that's not working the you know, brings a former worker in the guy comes in, looks at it, thinks about it, listens for a while goes up and Fax it. With a Hammer and sends the Bill owner

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
mill order of Bill for 10 pounds shillings, and the mill owner says, What 10 pounds for tapping with a hammer!

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And so the guy sends another bell to tapping the machine.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
That's hammer 10 shillings to knowing murder tap at 10 pounds.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
That's that's the difference the knowing where to tap, knowing where to make the mark, to fix the machine through a simple process.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:08.000
It's that knowledge. And I think that's the knowledge of knowing how to use AI to generate effective production prompts that, get it to do what you need it to do.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Because we all thought that. You know these white collar work jobs, these creative jobs were going to be safe from computers.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.000
You know we already lost a number of them like travel agents kind of lost that to computers.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:35.000
But copy writers, copy editors. Yeah, graphic designers.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Those were supposed to be safe jobs, but they're not in the age of AI.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:50.000
They're just not. It's really coming for those types of white-collar jobs so there's some fascinating discussions around law, legal research.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
So here was one from a while ago. Ask Chat Gpg.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000
To write a brief, wrote a beautiful brief, failed it perfectly written, persuasive, legal, brief, except on the case.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Citations were made up. Just kinda happen to make up the citations, but it just says, Look you get it, Lexus, you give it West law.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
You implement all of those in the training set, and Bam.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
It's just it's going to nail it.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
And in fact, it can do some basic legal research and get some core case is correct.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
You know I ask it here to do a discussion of student rights.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:36.000
The right to read in in school libraries what cases might come to bear specific to Ohio, and so, of course, came up with Pico and Tinker, which are 2 Supreme Court cases.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
But then it mentioned another one from an Ohio school district, and because it was the Us.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:49.000
District Court from Northern Ohio. It's definitely relevant to Ohio schools.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000
For a ruling that they violated the students. First member rights by removing those books.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
And so that's way to to start to do some of that legal research.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000
It can do some business intelligence work, hey? If somebody were gonna be buying Oclc.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Who might want a Bioslc and walk. So you can do business intelligence with it.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Where it has access to massive data sets dated.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:26.000
But massive data sets and things that everybody else has written about them which gives it the ability to mimic and predict new information that I can generate.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
You could do advocacy, formulaic writing like letters to the editor.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:38.000
It could write letters to the editor about something, it knows what letters to the editor sound like and read like.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:47.000
So the more information you can get it into the prompt, the more text you can give it into the prompt the better it's going to spit out.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
It can do marketing right a script with descriptions of graphics and video footage for a 30 s Psa run the benefits of having for parents of having children participate in summer reading programs.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Alpha Day, your local public library, and there's the script.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
And I thought, Hey, that's a decent script.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I wonder if they could make the whole advertisement and guess what?

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
This summer. Give your children the gift of adventure, learning, and fun at your local public library.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Our summer reading programs offer a variety of engaging activities that keep young minds active and help develop their love for reading.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Research shows that children who participate in summer reading programs maintain or improve their reading skills, preventing the summer sleep.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Joining is easy, and the programs are designed for kids of all ages.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Experience the joy of reading together, create lasting memories, and build a foundation for life-long learning.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Visit your local public library and sign up for the summer reading program. Today adventure awaits.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:57.000
It did I know the faces? Oh, God! And then the hair cuts!

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Oh, my goodness! It's creepy! It's horrible!

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
I know well, I you know that was me. It took me about half an hour to do that.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:12.000
All free. Using this text to video playground. I didn't give anything.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
If you actually give it video and pictures, there are other places that will do much better.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:27.000
But that was completely just kind of, you know, floating in there of, you know.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
What would it maybe look like it really couldn't do that.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
The slide with the graph. I could not get any AI to do generate like a fake graph.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:45.000
It just it didn't want to, but hey, for half an hour and free that's you know.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Not good enough. The audio was good enough, the script was good enough.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Yeah, the but stop and think, though, about what I asked.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Artificial intelligence to do. I ask it to, with no background imaging or video format, or anything.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:30.000
I gave it a sentence like literally the description that came out of Chat gpt in the script of Give me an aerial shot over a building in a green space and it gave me 2 s video that looked kind of like that the children are freaked out on but that.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:36.000
It could give me anything at all is wildly impressive.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Cause. If you would ask me 6 months ago I would have said, No, there's no way it can't.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000
No, a computer cannot. No? But yeah, it's already better than a storyboard.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:03.000
And do you know, when you think about that, good enough barrier it's good enough to get started with ideas that's crazy.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000
That's crazy for 30 min, and free artificial intelligence work.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000
That's pretty impressive. So where do we go from?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:32.000
There? Well, the new skill is being able to write that prompt figuring out, how do I use it as a tool to enhance my human productivity, so that I'm spending less time on good enough tasks and more time on making things great how do I put more into creating a prompt that will

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000
help the machine do a better job of creating something that I'm looking for.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
That's key. And I think that's one of the new skills we need to teach.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:54.000
In school, and to consider in workforce development. So questions if you don't have any questions, there are some questions that you might have, because I asked Chat Gbp.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:03.000
What questions might you have? I saw a question earlier about how fast does it work?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:13.000
And I'll show you that real quick. I think there was another question pretty recently here that I wanted to make sure, I answered, as well.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Will there be AI trained to detect AI?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Yes. AI trained detect. AI! It's not great.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
I've seen some rather humorous examples of the artificial intelligence saying that the Us.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Constitution was absolutely definitely written by AI. I have my own example where I was doing some training on getting the AI.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:46.000
To grade essay papers and rate new York State regents, exams, and I had a thing right an example in simpler paper at certain grading levels.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
I took one of those and pasted it into another new session of Chat Gpt.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:04.000
And asked it for a percentage in it, thought it was like, 92% sure that was written by human.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
And I told her I'm like dude. You wrote that I don't think I did. It's really good.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
I'm pretty sure that was human, which was kind of funny.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.000
So, yeah, you know, what? What are the questions that you have and what are the questions that you wanna ask?

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Let me show you. I noticed one, you know. One person asked for an example of how fast.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
So, as I said, there are different models. The default is Gpt.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
3.5 you'll see it's very much optimized for speed.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Gpt 4 is optimized, much more conciseness and reasoning.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
But the speed is lower let me show you what that really means.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Here's 2.5. Let's just give it a random topic.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.000
I don't know what this whole thing about Skyline chilly is. This is 3.5.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
It was pretty fast. If I do a new chat, and gpt 4.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Same problem. You're gonna see? It's much slower, much more deliberate.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But I think it gives a better answer off that.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So much slower, but still, when you consider in context of it, is writing, you know this, basically from scratch here, it's a it's a lot faster.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Can it do your taxes, the whole, miss, that we have to have accounts to do taxes?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
If a perpetuation basically of our crazy tax code.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because, yeah, it should be done for us absolutely.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I basically went in record and said, Look, if New York State isn't using AI to grade the essay exams within 2 years, they're wasting money and teacher time because it does a very good job, so we can see that a little bit of a comparison.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Here was 3.5 it doesn't have as many details.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It doesn't talk about, you know who developed it or when doesn't touch 4 starts out with that, you know.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Really great background information. We could ask it. What sources did you use to create this information?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Oh, sometimes it'll tell you sometimes it won't.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
If you have it with, you know, researchers, it'll do that.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So here, we'll kind of tell you.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But I mean, this is really well written.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Other questions, pre-trained information sources know not entirely known.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know, that's they don't wanna give up all their secrets.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I will tell you that in terms of pre-training process it is ridiculously expensive.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:48.000
We're talking millions, tens of millions of dollars, maybe hundreds of 1 million, into this training it is unbelievably intensive, computationally intensive, doing that pre training.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I do know from some of the stuff I've read, basically, was all of Wikipedia.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
2 huge sets of scanned books from Hotty and Google books.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Things like that. A lot of database, you know.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Newspaper indexes things like that full text. You can ask it to mimic or write in the style of a lot of different people.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
One of the fascinating ones that I did with teachers in terms of looking at us.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:39.000
History is we also to write a script for a debate between George Washington and Richard Nixon, on who was the better President, written in the style of Quentin Tarantino.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And not only did it nail, quotes in the style of speaking for Washington and Nixon, it absolutely nailed Quinton to Tarantino as well.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Yeah. So we will do all those things concerns with copyright right now.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:08.000
AI. Artificial intelligence cannot hold copyright now who don't hold the copyright is a little unclear.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Is it the program that you know the owners of the company that created the program?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Is it the person who wrote the prompt? It's a little unclear AI camp patent, either.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So yeah, AI, fascinating. There's another question in there about reliance on tools for atropy, of critical thinking.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And you know, mental skills that's, you know, if we look in terms of futuring, we can look at the potential stories of AI.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Some people are worried that it's a story of, you know, Terminator and Skynet and AI is used for damage and harm.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
We look at drone warfare, drone based warfare.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Things like that. Another potential story, a negative story, is that of Wally, of, you know, hey?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:12.000
We live a really comfortable, soft life, but the downside of that is, it's too soft.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And so not only do Dubai's decay, but mine's decay as well.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:41.000
The story that we write in in how we choose to use AI is going to be very important, but in terms of workforce development, what we have to be very clear about is that there are already a lot of jobs that are kind of make work.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And that AI can take over very quickly. And so that's going to be fascinating.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:10.000
AI added as a tool into Iep. Yes, I could definitely see AI being added as another type of assistive technology where students are given that direct access to differentiated content levels or other types of support.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:29.000
That already does exist in terms of assistive technology. When you think about teachers that right now, what they usually do are scan or retype something and ask it to, you know use a computer to do like a summarizing things like that.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So it's out there. I think AI can vastly improve it.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It's going to be a matter of somebody taking one of these large language models and using an Api which makes use of them.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So that they can create a secondary model, a specific application that is better trained to understand different levels of text complexity so that it can be more specific in terms of training.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:15.000
There are some I don't know a lot of them that are definitely specific to the library staff in terms of creating good engineering.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I'm going to drop a link in here to chat of a resource that I have been reading through that talks a lot about the computer science.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And some of the technology aspects and computational thinking aspects of that in the slides also, was that link to this, will from Steven Wolfram book, which I highly recommend. It.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
It gets very technical. I mean, there were times where I was like, okay, I'm gonna pretend that I understand this and move on.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But it really does help you start to see what's actually going on in the back end.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
So this is more of how to create. You know, engineering on the back end of that.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But it is something the other thing is just to go and try and practice what you're gonna see as you start to c create these prompts and get and get responses from Chechy between other places, the more information you give it the more background knowledge, you bring and can add into your prompt the

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:26.000
better. The result is probably going to be, and what's completely crazy mind-blowing is that you can ask Chachtt about.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:39.000
How could I improve the prote to be more productive I could actually, maybe help you write a better prompt, which is kind of crazy there, there's a lot of stuff, you know, a lot of people thinking about this and play missing out there.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And so just look for those and see what people are saying.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Is it safe to use woof, Maria, you asked an interesting question.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000
There, is it? Oh!

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
If you go to chat, dot open ai.com.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's not spy where it's not virus.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
If you just search and download like an app on your phone, they may be way overcharging you for something, or there may be other problems.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
There? Is it problematic? Yes, there are a couple of things that make it problematic.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Number one is anything that you do in there is being used, and there's no way to opt out of them making use of your training data.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yet they have said that they will be adding that, but it's not here yet in the Us.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:51.000
They just launched it in the EU today that ability to opt out one of the most problematic things is that all of these different ones Google, open AI, all of the companies that are trying to train these, they take massive massive data sets which they are getting by just sucking up all the

01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:06.000
open content, or maybe not so open content on the Internet and so problematic in the sense that it is being trained off of our collective work.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And so those are really fascinating. Article on one of the major tech blogs about, you know the fact that, hey?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:27.000
We all created the content, the text, the images, whatever the music that these ais have been trained on, and so should there be compensation back to the human.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:42.000
You know, race in some way for the content that's been created that allows ei to now get to the point where it's taking over our job.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
That's something for policy makers and philosophers to debate.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
But I think it's a festing question.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Yeah. Somebody posted in there a couple, of course, was coming up with American Library Association.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:05.000
It's definitely an emerging topic. It's going to continue to to emerge and development.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Any other questions?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I believe there was a question in the chat that may even miss.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I'm just going back through here. Risk asks.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Are you aware of them working on a new version, and will there always be a 2 year gap in information?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000
From what I've read. Open. AI is said.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
They're not. They have not yet begun training. Gpt.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
4.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:56.000
You know. Will there always be gap information? What they're doing right now is focusing on sort of add-ins to Chechgbt.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And so they have these.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
These new sort of, you know, Plugins, that you can reference.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And so there's like a plugin for Wolfram Alpha there are plugins for other things where they're working on now, connecting it out to the Internet.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:29.000
At large so that it can give more real time information based responses.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yeah, library programs are around getting patron S hands. I shared.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You know, the slides have been shared so that's something that you absolutely have access to you.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Can, you know, just use those. You can share them. Their creative commons, license.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Have Adam, I would say absolutely one of the great things to do is sort of look at those.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:04.000
How do we take this as a very complicated computational problem and turn into something that's understandable by the general public or things like that?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And I think one of those big things to look at then is thinking, Well, how do we?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
How do we make this really, truly understandable? And so that's that example of like a classroom Chatbot, of breaking down.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:27.000
How does a Chatbot work? How does it, you know, break down a question, thinking about how we, as humans ask and answer questions, how we, our brain works.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So there was a great video on Youtube about how Watson, Ibm trained Watson to answer questions on jeopardy that really helps you think about the Meta process of answering a question.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000
There's a great example, you know, in Steven Wolfram's book about okay we're going to talk about generation.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Let's break it down to a vocabulary that that only has 2 words and open parentheses and a close parenthesis.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And so you know what's most likely to start. Well, you can't start with a close parentheses, because that'd be illegal.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So you start with an open parentheses, you could immediately have a close parenthesis, but that'd be a very short conversation so you're probably gonna open a new parentheses and sort of just goes through this idea of just thinking about that mathematical probability of what's going to

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:29.000
come. Next, you know, playing a game like, you know, a telephone type, word story story storytelling game where everybody gets to add one sentence, or even one word.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Then you can start to do things around. Well, hey? You know, this is what we're doing when we're doing the generative aspect of Gpt together. There.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So I think those are important things, and then playing with the technology just having it set up, showing them how to get in.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:55.000
It's relatively easy to create. You need to, you know, set up easy ways to like, link it to Google account, or something like that.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:05.000
If you are going to do it during programming during the program, you might wanna pay for the chat Gpt plus, it's $20 a month currently individual licenses.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:21.000
They don't have a business license, because then you're not going to get blocked out because at term times of high usage you can get blocked where it says, Hey, we're overloaded, and then you can get access as well, for plus to chat gtt fork

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Gpt is not great at locating sources or identifying where information may be necessarily for modern issues, because, remember training, Cutoff, date of 2021, you can ask it.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
When you treat it like an answer engine instead of a search engine like an answer engine.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And you ask a basic question sometimes it'll tell you.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You know this website says, or things like that.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And I actually use that with my daughter, where she had a a question, and we asked Chat gpt about it, and it gave an answer and said, Well, you know, on this website they talked about and we didn't use Chatsybd's answer because it was out of date.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
We were looking for statistics on shark attacks, but we went to the website that it referenced.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And so using a kind of like Wikipedia, where it's a starting point, and going from there suggesting for where to go for further information.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:32.000
As you train teachers in New York State. I would know how to answer that in Ohio I don't necessarily know what I answered that, and so I'm not as familiar with Ohio as I am with some other States.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But all of my resources are are online, and I have old dropbox folder of different ones that I've done.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Oh! Around chat, gpt resources. So they're all of my chat, gpt resources that I'm happy to share, which has some example.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Breings for school leaders, instructional leaders go admin school librarians, you know, slide deck lesson plans, all kinds of things.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
