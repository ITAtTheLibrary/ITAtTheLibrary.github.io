        <h1>A Poem for Libraries</h1>
        <p class="poem">
            In hallowed halls of whispered words,<br>
            Where tales of old and new converge,<br>
            Stands a sanctuary, mightily unfurled,<br>
            A portal to every conceivable world.<br>
            <br>
            The library, a cathedral of thought,<br>
            Where the wisdom of ages is diligently sought,<br>
            Echoes with the rustle of turning page,<br>
            A timeless stage, transcending age.<br>
            <br>
            Bound in leather, cloth, and thread,<br>
            In every book, a world is spread,<br>
            Stories of love, of valor, of dread,<br>
            In the reader's heart and mind, they're fed.<br>
            <br>
            Oceans of knowledge in tranquil rows,<br>
            Guided by the lantern of those who know,<br>
            Where the seeds of curiosity grow,<br>
            And the river of enlightenment freely flows.<br>
            <br>
            In the silence, an orchestra plays,<br>
            Of words dancing in a ballet of phrase,<br>
            The past and future in each display,<br>
            In the grand library where time decays.<br>
            <br>
            No palace is as richly stocked,<br>
            As libraries, with their endless flock<br>
            Of books, where minds are unlocked,<br>
            And the doors of perception are gently knocked.<br>
            <br>
            So enter with a humble heart,<br>
            Allow the journey to start,<br>
            In this place, art and smarts,<br>
            Find their ever-glowing hearth.<br>
            <br>
            In the library, great and vast,<br>
            A testament to our diverse past,<br>
            The world in words, in shadows cast,<br>
            A sanctuary built to last.<br>
